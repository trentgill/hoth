implementing forth:

two big parts that could each be a week long project. 1: getting the interpreter running in a repl. 2: compiling forth words into your dictionary.

part one is solely about the following forth sentence:

"5 DUP * . BYE"

it squares the number 5 and print the result (25) to the terminal.

first steps:
- consider the stack. how can it be implemented in your language
	asm has it built in conceptually
	C you can allocate some memory & save a pointer
	haskell.. good luck!
- nb: the stack can contain anything (numbers, strings, flags, tokens)


- hardcode each of the 5 forth words in the sentence.
	5 		pushes the number 5 to the stack
	DUP 	duplicates the value on the top of the stack
	*		pops 2 values from stack and pushes their product
	.		pops the top of stack and prints it to terminal
	BYE		exits the forth
> these are like functions.. but they're 'words'
> try calling each one directly with test data on the stack

- write a main loop that executes these 4 words in series
	requires a 'program counter'
	consider 'next' keyword
	forth's `INIT`

- now we want to change the sentence above to:

"5 SQUARED ."

wrap 'DUP *' into a forth word called 'SQUARED'
	SQUARED should execute DUP then *
	this is a 'composite' word that we are *hand compiling*
	implement the ability to call `SQUARED` in the same manner as the other words >> the helper to make this work is called 'DOCOLON'
	keyword 'return stack'

- you have some native words, and a single composite word compiled by hand!


// the interpreter
our forth currently only runs the words we define in our main function. in order to allow our program to do different things, we need to take a variable list of commands.

we need to implement `INTERPRET` which is itself made of forth words:

: INTERPRET ( -- )
  BL WORD FIND
  IF EXECUTE
  ELSE >NUMBER
  THEN
;

- for now we won't implement this directly, but instead build the consituent parts. the functionality is:
	`BL WORD` parses input string until `BL` is encountered, and push the parsed word onto the stack
	`FIND` search the dictionary for the word on the stack. push the 'execution token' of that word onto the stack if it's found, 
	`IF EXECUTE` 


// on the command line
now we need some infrastructure so we can run more than one sentence. `QUIT` is the outermost interpreter loop. it does 4 things:
	empty the return stack
		`ACCEPT` a line of input from the terminal
		`INTERPRET` which is itself a loop that interprets the ACCEPTed line
		Repeat from `ACCEPT`

- you'll need to add some IO to your application via stdin/out or your languages console io
